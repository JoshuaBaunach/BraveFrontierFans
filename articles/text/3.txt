JPBF and Site Updates
April 30, 2015
Hey there! If you haven't noticed, a new link has been added to the side of the page! Although it probably leads to a work-in-progress page (or no page at all), it will eventually be the tier lists! Also, JPBF recently got an update. Among the updates to JPBF are 30-stage Frontier Hunter and Karl EX Trial. I already tried 30-stage FH, yet I was beaten on the Kikuri stage. Also, Karl's trial seems pretty hard. Ushi posted a video <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahEfgcwYzo4>here</a> showing how he does it.
