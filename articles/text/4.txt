More Site Updates and Other Stuff
May 5, 2015
Hello again! To begin this entry, try checking out the damage calculator! It is fully functional and you can input whatever you like to see how much damage you can deal. Also, I have the water and fire tier lists up and running, so check those out too! Aside from site news, all global dungeons have been opened up in JPBF, so you can utilize the opportunity to earn lots of gems. Plus, the new referral rewards were implemented into JPBF as well, so take advantage of those too!
